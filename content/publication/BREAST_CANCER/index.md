abstract: "The integration of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and large language models (LLMs) applied to publicly available cancer patient data offers a transformative opportunity in clinical settings. By enabling the extraction of predictive patterns from omics data and translating them into interpretable reports, we support breast
cancer (BC) grade prognosis assessment and more informed patient care. Addressing the challenge of interobserver variability in histological tumor grading, a key BC prognostic indicator, we introduce a framework that leverages transcriptomic data to predict histological grade in estrogen receptor-positive/HER2-negative BC patients. This data-driven tool holds promises for improving diagnostic accuracy and guiding clinical decision-making. Furthermore, by combining XAI with LLM-driven grade reporting, we generate clinically relevant outputs in articulated stakeholder-specific language that meet the different informational needs of clinicians and patients. This approach enables actionable insights for clinicians while empowering patients with personalized information, thereby supporting informed and patient-centered decision-making in oncology care."
